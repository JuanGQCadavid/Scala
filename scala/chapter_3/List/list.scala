	* List aren't mutable, so you coud'n change the value afther the initialize. 

	* The Mid-operator ::: is a method of List, and indicates concatenation (Creat a new list by the comment before)

	*onces you initialize, it's imposible to change.

	* the ::: Operator agrup the list in one new list.

	* One of the big ideas of the functional style of programming is that methods should not have side
		effects. A method's only act should be to compute and return a value. Some benefits gained when you
		take this approach are that methods become less entangled, and therefore more reliable and reusable.
		Another benefit (in a statically typed language) is that everything that goes into and out of a method is
		checked by a type checker, so logic errors are more likely to manifest themselves as type errors.
		Applying this functional philosophy to the world of objects means making objects immutable.
